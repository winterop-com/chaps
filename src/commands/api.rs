//! `varde api` — one authenticated request to chap-core, and its answer.
//!
//! The escape hatch under every other command that talks to Chap: `varde
//! status` asks two fixed questions and `varde jobs` reads one endpoint, and
//! everything else chap-core can do is reached from here. It is deliberately
//! thin - a base URL, a token and a body - so that the things it is used for
//! (building a dataset, starting a backtest, reading the metrics back) can be
//! written down in the book as commands rather than as curl invocations with a
//! token pasted into them.
//!
//! What it adds over `curl` is exactly three things: the base URL of *this*
//! deployment, the `Authorization` header from its `.env`, and an exit code
//! that tells "Chap is not up" (2) from "Chap said no" (1).
