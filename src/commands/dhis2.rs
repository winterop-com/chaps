//! `varde dhis2` — the three things that let the DHIS2 Modeling App reach Chap.
//!
//! Phase 1 of the `dhis2` component put a DHIS2 and a Chap side by side and
//! left them unable to talk. This is the other half, and it is entirely
//! requests to DHIS2: the app reaches chap-core through a DHIS2 Route, reads
//! its figures out of the `analytics_*` tables, and does not exist at all until
//! it is installed. [`crate::dhis2`] holds the protocol and the rules; this
//! module is the command surface, the waits and what is said about them.
//!
//! Four verbs that change DHIS2, one that does not, and one that changes
//! only this deployment's record of which DHIS2 it is:
//!
//! - `show` asks and reports, and is safe on anything;
//! - `route` creates the `chap` route, or **repoints** one that is there;
//! - `analytics` generates the tables and waits for them;
//! - `apps` installs the Modeling App and the Climate App from the App Hub;
//! - `connect` does the route, the apps and then analytics, in that order;
//! - `use` records a DHIS2 that runs elsewhere, which the others then talk to
//!   in place of the `dhis2` component.
//!
//! Every one of them is idempotent: run twice and the second run says there was
//! nothing to do. Nothing here is done by `varde up`, and
//! [the chapter](../../docs/dhis2.md) says why.
