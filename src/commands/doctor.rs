//! `varde doctor` - one bounded checklist that says whether this machine, and
//! this deployment, can run Chap.
//!
//! Every other command answers one question. `doctor` answers the ones an
//! operator would otherwise ask in sequence: is Docker there, is the daemon
//! up, is Compose new enough, is there disk, can this machine reach the hosts
//! Chap pulls from - and, inside a deployment, are the files, the ports, the
//! pins and the running stack what they should be.
//!
//! Two rules shape the module. Every check is bounded: external commands are
//! killed when they overrun and every network probe carries a timeout, so
//! `varde doctor` always finishes. And every verdict is a pure function of
//! data someone else gathered, so the half that decides what to say is
//! testable without Docker, a network or a project.
