//! `varde update [--dry-run]` — move the pins forward and pull.
//!
//! Two kinds of pin move here. A model that follows a channel is re-resolved
//! against the marketplace, and the only other thing that moves those is
//! `varde models enable`; exact pins (`--version`) never move. chap-core's own
//! pin moves too when it is a release tag and a newer release exists, which
//! also re-fetches the `compose.ghcr.yml` that release publishes. A moving
//! chap-core tag (`latest`, `master`, `dev`) is only refreshed by the pull,
//! unless `--pin-chap-core` turns it into a release pin.
//!
//! `--chap-tag` is the other direction: not forward, but somewhere else
//! entirely. It is the same run with chap-core's destination decided by the
//! operator rather than by the release feed, and the one move that can cost
//! data - a release older than the one running, or a release after a moving
//! tag, since `dev` and `master` are ahead of every release - is named and
//! confirmed before anything is fetched, written or pulled. `--list-tags`
//! answers where a deployment can go, and writes nothing at all.
//!
//! What it does not do is touch a container. The run reads: the plan, then
//! the pull, then one line saying what moved and which running services are
//! now out of date. Applying that is `varde restart`, and starting a
//! deployment that is down is `varde up`; an update that did either would be
//! a deployment nobody asked for.
//!
//! "Out of date" is two questions asked of every running container. Is the
//! image it runs still the image its reference points at, now that the pull
//! has finished? And is the configuration hash compose stamped on it still
//! the hash compose computes for the files as they are? Either answer being
//! no means the service is running something the project no longer describes.
