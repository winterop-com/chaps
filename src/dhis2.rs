//! DHIS2's Web API, and the three things that let the Modeling App reach Chap.
//!
//! Nothing in a Chap deployment talks to DHIS2 and nothing in DHIS2 talks to
//! chap-core. The only thing that talks to both is the Modeling App running in
//! a browser, and it reaches chap-core through **DHIS2's Route API**: a `Route`
//! row inside DHIS2 with `code: "chap"`, which DHIS2 then reverse-proxies under
//! `/api/routes/chap/run/`. So the work of connecting the two is three
//! requests to DHIS2 and none to chap-core:
//!
//! - the route, or the app redirects to `/get-started`;
//! - the analytics tables, or the app has nothing to send;
//! - the apps themselves, installed from the App Hub, or there is no Chap user
//!   interface at all.
//!
//! This is a second HTTP client rather than a second caller of
//! [`crate::api`]. That one is chap-core's: it sends `Authorization: Bearer`,
//! and its transport failure is the sentence `varde status` prints about
//! chap-core. DHIS2 takes HTTP Basic, answers a `WebMessage` rather than
//! FastAPI's `{"detail": ...}`, and a DHIS2 that is not answering is a
//! different sentence with a different command at the end of it. The response
//! shape is shared - [`crate::api::Answer`] - because a status, a body and a
//! content type are the same three things whoever sent them.
//!
//! The password is never printed, never traced and never returned by
//! [`Credentials`]'s `Debug`. `-v` narrates the request line and says that an
//! `Authorization: Basic` header went out, exactly as [`crate::api`] does for
//! the token.
