//! `chaps run` group it belongs to, and tell what each one is without parsing
//! compose project names. Nothing in them depends on the chaps version or the
//! time: a changed label makes compose recreate the container, so an upgrade
//! of this CLI must render the same labels as the one before it.

// The keys are defined once, beside the query that reads them back
// ([`crate::docker::chaps_containers`]); these are the names the renderers use.
