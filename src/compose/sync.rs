//! Rendering `.chaps/` into the compose files at the project root.
//!
//! `.chaps/` is intent; `compose.yml`, `compose.chaps.yml`,
//! `compose.<service_id>.yml` and `compose.marketplace.yml` are artifacts.
//! [`sync`] is the one place that
//! turns the former into the latter: `apply` ends in it, `chaps sync` calls it
//! directly and `chaps up` runs it before `docker compose up`.
//!
//! Rendering is deterministic and every file is compared before it is
//! written, so a second sync reports everything as unchanged. `compose.yml`
//! is deterministic too because the copy of chap-core's `compose.ghcr.yml` it
//! is rendered from is kept in `.chaps/`; nothing here touches the network.
