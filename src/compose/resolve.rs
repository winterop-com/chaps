//! Which account a marketplace model's service runs as, read off the image.
//!
//! A model image declares the account it runs as in `config.User`, and forcing
//! a different one is how a model ends up unable to execute its own binaries:
//! the Rwanda BYM model shipped root-owned, mode 744 INLA binaries up to
//! 0.1.1, so a hardened `user: chapkit:chapkit` turned every prediction into
//! `inla.run: Permission denied`. So the image is asked, in the order the
//! answers can be trusted: the flag, the registry, the local daemon, and only
//! then the table compiled into this binary.
//!
//! What comes out is recorded on the [`crate::project::EnabledModel`], which
//! is what keeps `chaps sync` offline and deterministic: the lookup happens
//! once, when a model is enabled or moved to a new tag, and every render after
//! that reads the answer out of `.chaps/models.yaml`.
