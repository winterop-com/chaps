//! A thin authenticated HTTP client for chap-core's API.
//!
//! [`crate::status`] asks chap-core two fixed questions and turns the answers
//! into a report. This is the other half: any method, any path, the body handed
//! back as it arrived. `chaps api` is the command that exposes it, and
//! `chaps jobs` is the first caller that uses it for something shaped.
//!
//! Three rules it keeps, so every caller reports the same things the same way:
//!
//! - A transport failure is [`ChapError::Unreachable`], which is the sentence
//!   `chaps status` uses plus the command that explains it. An HTTP status is
//!   not a failure here - the body of a 404 is often the only place chap-core
//!   says what it did not find - so a non-2xx answer comes back as an
//!   [`Answer`] and the caller decides.
//! - The API token goes out as `Authorization: Bearer`, never in a trace line.
//! - `-v` narrates the request line and the headers, `-d` adds the body.
