//! The deployments varde has written on this machine, by compose project.
//!
//! A compose project name ends in random characters
//! ([`crate::project::new_compose_project_name`]), so a volume docker holds
//! cannot be traced back to the directory that made it. `varde cleanup` needs
//! exactly that to tell the data of a deployment that was deleted from the
//! data of one that is only down, so every save of a project records its
//! name and directory here, in `<data dir>/deployments.yaml`.
//!
//! Best-effort throughout: a record that could not be written only means
//! `varde cleanup` leaves that deployment's volumes alone, which is the safe
//! way to be wrong.
