//! `.varde/components.yaml` — which pieces a deployment is made of.
//!
//! A deployment is chap-core plus whatever else was asked for. chap-core is a
//! component like the others, on by default; OCS (Open Climate Service), an
//! S3-compatible object store and DHIS2 are opt-in. The file is intent, like
//! `project.yaml` and `models.yaml`: `varde sync` renders one compose file per
//! enabled component from it.
//!
//! Every field carries a `serde` default, so a file that leaves a field out,
//! or a project without the file, loads as "chap-core on, nothing else".
//!
//! Two fields in here are records rather than intent, and each says so where it
//! is declared: [`OcsComponent::read_only`] mirrors what
//! `ocs/climate-service.yaml` says, and [`Dhis2Component::connected_at`] notes
//! when `varde dhis2 connect` last finished. Neither is ever read as evidence -
//! OCS reads its own config file, and only `varde dhis2 show` asks DHIS2.
