/// (`ocs/**`, then `dhis2/**`), then the root `compose*.yml`.
///
/// `.varde/tmp/` is scratch space (this is where the archive is staged) and
/// half-written `.tmp` state files are transient, so neither is included.
/// Compose files are taken from the project root only; a `compose.yml` in a
/// subdirectory belongs to something else.
///
/// The component directories are in here because what they hold is the
/// operator's own, not a rendered artifact: `varde sync` only ever creates a
/// missing `ocs/climate-service.yaml` or `dhis2/dhis.conf`, so nothing can
/// rebuild the edits made to one, and DHIS2 does not start at all without its.
/// [`crate::components::Component::dir`] is asked rather than any of them being
/// named here, because a name in this function is a name the next component is
/// forgotten from - which is exactly how `dhis2/dhis.conf` came to be missing
/// from every archive.
///
/// A directory is taken whether or not its component is enabled right now: a
/// file that exists is one somebody wrote, `varde components disable` says the
/// directory is left alone because it is the operator's, and a backup that
/// dropped it the moment the component went off would lose it at the one moment
/// nothing else is looking after it.
