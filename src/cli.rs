//! The `varde` command tree.
//!
//! Doc comments on the types and fields are the `--help` text, and every one of
//! them is a single clause: asking for help is not asking for the manual, so the
//! explanations live in the book (`docs/`) and the reference chapter is
//! generated from these one-liners. A subcommand's own help comes from its
//! variant in the enum, never from the argument struct the variant names. This
//! module and `main.rs` are complete: the command modules only read the arg
//! structs.
