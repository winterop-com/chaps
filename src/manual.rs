//! Models that are not in the marketplace: resolving what `varde models add`
//! was given into an entry a deployment can run.
//!
//! The marketplace answers three questions about a model: which image, which
//! tag, and how the container has to be run. For a repository that is not in
//! the catalogue, those answers have to come from the repository and the
//! image themselves - GitHub for the commits, ghcr for the published tags and
//! the image config, and docker only where neither can say. What comes out is
//! recorded in `.varde/models-manual.yaml` and synthesised back into a
//! marketplace-shaped entry ([`crate::project::ManualModel::to_model`]), so
//! every command downstream treats it like any other model.
