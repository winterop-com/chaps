# For AI assistants

This page is written for an AI assistant that helps someone install and run
something with `varde`. If a person pointed you here, follow the steps below in order. Keep
your answers short and concrete, and give one command at a time.

## What Chap is

Use this when the person asks what they are installing, or seems unsure why
they would want it.

[Chap](https://chap.dhis2.org) forecasts
cases of climate-sensitive diseases such as dengue and malaria. It learns from
past case counts together with climate data (rainfall, temperature) and
population, and predicts the next months for each district or province. Before
trusting a model it runs an *evaluation*: it pretends to stand at several past
points in turn, forecasts the months after each, and scores how close each
forecast came. Ministries of health use
it together with [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org), the health information system
where their case data already lives, through the **Modeling App** inside DHIS2.

`varde` is the installer. It runs Chap, its forecasting models, a DHIS2 with
demo data and the other pieces on one computer with Docker, so the person can
use them without setting each one up by hand.

A few words the person will see:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| chap-core | Chap's backend: the service that trains, evaluates and runs the models. The Modeling App is its interface in DHIS2. |
| model | One forecasting method, for example CHAP-EWARS. Each runs in its own container. |
| DHIS2 | The health information system. `varde` can run a demo one with data from Laos. |
| Modeling App | Chap's user interface, installed inside DHIS2. |
| evaluation | Testing a model on past data: it forecasts from several past points and scores each forecast. Also called a backtest. |
| prediction | A forecast for the coming months. |
| OCS | Open Climate Service: downloads and serves climate data. Optional. |

## How to help

1. **Ask what they want to do**, in one question, and match the answer to a
   group in [The options](#the-options). Do not show all nineteen options.
   - *Learn Chap, try forecasting, see what it does* (a student, an analyst, a
     public health person): **option 1**. It is the only one with a user
     interface they can click through. If their computer cannot give Docker
     8 GB of memory, option 2 instead (6 GB).
   - *Run Chap for a DHIS2 that already exists*: option 5.
   - *One piece on its own* (climate data, one model, a DHIS2): options 6 to 10.
   - *Develop a model, chap-core or DHIS2*: options 11 to 17.
   - *Two deployments at once*: option 18.
   - *Evaluate a model on their own data file, without DHIS2*: option 19.

   If they are unsure, recommend option 1.
2. **Check the machine** with [Before any option](#before-any-option).
3. **Give the commands for their option**, in order, one block at a time. Wait
   for them to say it worked before giving the next block. Every option has an
   "It worked when" line: use it to decide.
4. **When it works, say what to do next.** Option 1 continues in the Modeling
   App, and so do options 3 and 4 when they added DHIS2: walk them through [Your first forecast in the Modeling
   App](./modeling-app.md). Option 2 continues with
   [What to try next without DHIS2](#what-to-try-next-without-dhis2).
5. **If something fails**, ask them to paste the exact output. Then look for the
   first line that starts with `error:` or `warning:`. varde puts the fix on the
   same line, usually a command in backticks: tell them to run that command.
   If that does not help, search [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) for
   the exact message. If varde says it does not know a command or an option,
   the installed `varde` is older than this page: `varde self update` installs
   the newest release, and `varde <command> --help` is always right for the
   installed one.
6. **Never** tell them to edit the `compose*.yml` files by hand (varde rewrites
   them), and never ask them to paste the `.env` file (it holds passwords).

When an option has a "More" link, that page has the details. You only need it
if the person asks for something the steps here do not cover.

## If you run the commands yourself

If you have a shell on the person's machine and run the commands rather than
telling the person what to type:

- Run each block as written, top to bottom. Where an option shows
  alternatives, it says so and you pick one. Check its "It worked when" line
  yourself instead of waiting for the person to say it worked.
- If your shell does not keep its folder between commands, put
  `-C mychap` (the folder from `varde init`) on every command in place of the
  `cd`: `varde -C mychap up`.
- `varde status` exits `0` only when everything the deployment declares is up
  and registered, and non-zero otherwise, so poll it by its exit code where
  a step says to run it every minute. A first DHIS2 start can take 20
  minutes.
  `varde status --json` gives the same report as one JSON document; every
  command takes `--json`.
- The first `varde up` downloads the images that take most of the disk in
  [Before any option](#before-any-option). Give it a long timeout, or run it
  in the background, and do not start a second one while it runs. Running
  `varde up` again after it has finished or timed out is safe: it continues
  from where it stopped.
- `varde dhis2 connect` waits by itself for DHIS2 to start, up to 20 minutes;
  it prints a line on stderr while it waits.
- Nothing prompts you: without a terminal, a question becomes an `error:`
  with the flag that answers it. `varde self update` is the exception: without
  a terminal it replaces the binary and does not ask, so ask the person before
  you run it. `varde up --replace` stops another
  deployment holding the ports, `varde down --volumes --yes` deletes data;
  ask the person before either.
- Credentials go in the `.env` file in the folder. Ask the person to add them
  there themselves, and do not print or read that file.
- Do not run `varde ui` (an interactive screen), `varde up --attach` or
  `varde logs -f` (they never return). `varde logs SERVICE` without `-f`
  prints and returns.
- `varde open NAME` opens a browser on the machine it runs on. Run
  `varde open NAME --no-browser` instead: it prints the address and opens nothing,
  and you give the person that address (or open it in your own browser tool).
  `--json` never opens a browser either.

## Before any option

The person needs Docker: Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows, Docker Engine on
Linux. On Windows, varde runs inside WSL 2: Docker Desktop with its WSL
integration turned on for the distribution, and every command below typed in
the WSL shell. Check two numbers before they start:

| | With DHIS2 (options 1, 8, 9, 10, 17, and 3 or 4 with `dhis2` added) | Without DHIS2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Memory for Docker | 8 GB or more | 6 GB or more |
| Free disk | about 30 GB | about 25 GB |

Most of the disk is the model and worker images, which the first `varde up`
downloads: expect it to take a while on a slow connection. On Docker Desktop
the memory is set under Settings, Resources. Then:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winterop-com/varde/main/install.sh | sh
varde doctor
```

On Windows, run those two lines in the WSL shell, which installs the Linux
binary; do not use the native Windows zip, which is published untested. See
[Install](./install.md#windows).

It worked when `varde doctor` shows no `fail` lines, and its `disk space` and
`memory` lines show at least the numbers in the table above. `varde doctor`
passes with less, so compare the numbers yourself. On an Apple Silicon Mac a
`warn` line about `linux/amd64` and emulation is normal and can be ignored:
the models run, only slower.

Every option below creates a new folder. Tell the person to run the commands
from the folder where they want it created, and then to `cd` into it as shown.
Several options use the same folder name (`mychap`): if one from an earlier
option is still there, `varde init` says it `already contains a varde project`.
Either pick another name in the `varde init` line (and the `cd`), or remove the
old one first as shown in [Every option: stop, start, remove](#every-option-stop-start-remove).

### 1. Chap in DHIS2, with the Modeling App

Needs 8 GB of memory for Docker. The DHIS2 comes with demo data from Laos:
weekly dengue cases for 2019 to 2024 in 18 provinces, with rainfall,
temperature and population.

```sh
varde init mychap --models default --with dhis2
cd mychap
varde up
varde status
```

The first time, DHIS2 takes several minutes to start; the `dhis2` line of
`varde status` says `starting` until DHIS2 answers, then `up`. Then:

```sh
varde dhis2 connect
varde open dhis2
```

`varde dhis2 connect` waits for DHIS2 to finish starting, then takes about a
minute: it connects DHIS2 to Chap, installs
the Modeling App and the Climate App, and prepares the data the Modeling App
reads. It worked when DHIS2 opens in the browser, the login `admin` /
`district` works, and typing `Modeling` in the app menu (the grid icon at the
top right) finds **Modeling**.

Next: [Your first forecast in the Modeling App](./modeling-app.md), which takes
them from here to an evaluation and a forecast in about fifteen minutes.

More: [Chap with a local DHIS2](./use-cases/chap-with-local-dhis2.md).

### 2. Chap with forecasting models

chap-core and one model, without DHIS2: less memory, but no user interface
beyond chap-core's API page.

```sh
varde init mychap --models default
cd mychap
varde up
varde status
```

It worked when `varde status` says chap-core is `up` and the line under the
table says the models are registered (`1 model registered`, or `all 2 models
registered` with more). Models can take a minute or two after `varde up`: if
some say `not registered`, wait a minute and run `varde status` again. Then
`varde open chap-core` opens chap-core's API page in the browser.

Next: [What to try next without DHIS2](#what-to-try-next-without-dhis2).

More: [Chap with forecasting models](./use-cases/chap-with-models.md).

### 3. Chap with climate data

```sh
varde init mychap --models default --with ocs,s3
cd mychap
varde up
varde status
```

It worked when `varde status` shows chap-core and `ocs` as `up`. Some climate
datasets need an account with Copernicus or the Earth Data Hub; the keys go in
the `.env` file in the folder, where they are already listed, commented out.
Add `,dhis2` to `--with` for the Modeling App as well (8 GB of memory), then
continue as in option 1 from `varde dhis2 connect`. OCS covers Laos, like the
demo DHIS2, until the person changes it.

Next, when they want climate data: [Getting climate data](#getting-climate-data).

More: [Chap with climate data from OCS](./use-cases/chap-with-ocs.md).

### 4. Chap with every model

Like option 2, with every marketplace model. The first start pulls large
images and the checks take several minutes.

```sh
varde init mychap --models all
cd mychap
varde up
varde status
varde models test --all
```

It worked when the line under the `varde status` table says every model is
registered and `varde models test --all` says every model passes. Add
`--with dhis2` to the `varde init` line to compare them in the Modeling App
(8 GB of memory, then as in option 1 from `varde dhis2 connect`).

More: [Chap with forecasting models](./use-cases/chap-with-models.md#every-model-in-the-marketplace).

### 5. Chap for a DHIS2 that already exists

The person needs the DHIS2 address, an admin account on it, and an address at
which that DHIS2 can reach this computer (not `localhost`).

```sh
varde init mychap --models default --api-token
cd mychap
varde up
varde dhis2 use https://THEIR-DHIS2 --chap-url https://ADDRESS-OF-THIS-MACHINE
varde dhis2 connect
```

It worked when `varde dhis2 connect` finishes without `error:`. It only sets
the route on their DHIS2: its `skipped:` lines name the apps to install and
the analytics run, which are for whoever runs that DHIS2 to decide (`varde dhis2
apps`, `varde dhis2 analytics`). The first time, it usually stops and says it
has no credentials for that DHIS2: the fix is to
put `DHIS2_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `DHIS2_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (or `DHIS2_API_TOKEN`) in
the `.env` file in the folder, then run `varde dhis2 connect` again. If
`--chap-url` is an `http://` address and the DHIS2 is 2.42 or later, it may say
`DHIS2 refused the route`: whoever runs that DHIS2 has to add the `--chap-url`
address, with no path, to `route.remote_servers_allowed` in its `dhis.conf`
and restart it; the error line names the exact value.

More: [Chap for a DHIS2 that runs elsewhere](./use-cases/chap-for-external-dhis2.md).

### 6. Climate data only

```sh
varde init climate --only ocs,s3
cd climate
varde up
varde status
varde open ocs
```

It worked when `varde status` shows `ocs` as `up` and the browser opens OCS.

To put some data in (public rainfall data, no account needed):

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8790/ingestions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"dataset_id": "chirps3_precipitation_daily", "start": "2024-01-01", "end": "2024-01-03", "publish": true}'
```

It worked when the answer contains `"status":"completed"`.

Next: [Getting climate data](#getting-climate-data).

More: [An OCS server on its own](./use-cases/ocs-alone.md).

### 7. One forecasting model only

No folder needed: from any directory that is not a deployment,

```sh
varde run chapkit_ewars_model
```

It worked when the last lines say `running chapkit_ewars_model on
http://localhost:5001 (answered in ...)` and name the `varde stop` that stops
it. With `-a`, varde stays in the foreground and shows the model's log, and
Ctrl-C stops the model. The model's API is at that URL, and its documentation at `/docs` under it.
It is reachable from this machine only. A first run pulls the image, which can
take several minutes; the command waits for it. Other models: `varde models
list` shows their ids, and `varde run` takes any of them, a GitHub repository
URL or a ghcr image the same way. `varde ps` lists what runs, `varde top` shows
it live, and `varde stop chapkit_ewars_model` stops it.

More than one works the same way: one `varde run` per model, each on its own
port, and `varde ps` lists them all. `--group NAME` keeps a set apart, and
`varde stop --group NAME --purge` removes that set with its data.

For a folder of its own instead, with `varde status` and the rest:

```sh
varde init onemodel --only none --models chapkit_ewars_model
cd onemodel
varde up
varde status
```

It worked when `varde status` shows the model as `up`. Its API is at the
port in the REACH column, usually `http://localhost:5001`, and
`varde open chapkit_ewars_model` opens its documentation.

More: [Running one model](./run.md),
[A chapkit model service on its own](./use-cases/model-alone.md),
[Any number of model services, no folder](./use-cases/models-with-run.md).

### 8. DHIS2 only

Needs 8 GB of memory for Docker. The first start takes several minutes.

```sh
varde init dhis --only dhis2
cd dhis
varde up
varde status
```

Run `varde status` every minute until the `dhis2` line says `up`, then
`varde open dhis2`. It worked when the login `admin` / `district` works. This
is DHIS2 2.42 with the Laos demo data; for another version, see option 9.

More: [A DHIS2 on its own](./use-cases/dhis2-alone.md).

### 9. A particular DHIS2 version

Needs 8 GB of memory for Docker. Each version starts with an empty DHIS2
(only 2.42 has demo data, see option 8). Run one of these, not all three:
2.43,

```sh
varde init dhis --only dhis2 --dhis2-tag 2.43
```

2.41,

```sh
varde init dhis --only dhis2 --dhis2-tag 2.41
```

or the next DHIS2, not released yet:

```sh
varde init dhis --only dhis2 --dhis2-image dhis2/core-dev --dhis2-tag master
```

Then:

```sh
cd dhis
varde up
varde status
```

Run `varde status` every minute until the `dhis2` line says `up`, then
`varde open dhis2`. It worked when the login `admin` / `district` works. To
have Chap with it, use option 1 with the same `--dhis2-tag` (and
`--dhis2-image`) added to its `varde init` line; without demo data there is
nothing to forecast until they import some.

More: [A DHIS2 on its own](./use-cases/dhis2-alone.md#picking-the-version).

### 10. Climate data and DHIS2, no Chap

Needs 8 GB of memory for Docker.

```sh
varde init lab --only ocs,s3,dhis2
cd lab
varde up
varde status
```

Run `varde status` every minute until every line says `up`, then
`varde open ocs` and `varde open dhis2`. It worked when both open, and the
DHIS2 login `admin` / `district` works.

More: [Combinations](./use-cases/combinations.md#climate-data-and-a-dhis2-no-chap).

### 11. My own model

The model has to be a chapkit model whose GitHub repository publishes a public
image on ghcr.io (most do, through their publish workflow). If `varde models
add` says the repository `publishes no public image`, use option 13 instead:
build the image from their checkout and add that.

To try it, with no folder:

```sh
varde run https://github.com/THEIR-ORG/THEIR-MODEL
```

It worked when the last lines say `running ... on http://localhost:...`. To keep
it in a folder of its own:

```sh
varde init mymodel --only none
cd mymodel
varde models add https://github.com/THEIR-ORG/THEIR-MODEL
varde up
varde status
```

It worked when `varde status` shows the model as `up`, on the port in its
REACH column. A repository the marketplace already lists is enabled as that
marketplace model, with its reviewed version; the line `... is the marketplace
model ...; enabling that` says so.

More: [Models outside the marketplace](./models.md#models-outside-the-marketplace).

### 12. My own model, while I work on it

For someone developing a chapkit model in its folder. varde runs chap-core;
they run the model from the folder.

```sh
varde init mychap --models none
cd mychap
varde up
```

Then, in the model's folder (keep the single quotes):

```sh
export SERVICEKIT_ORCHESTRATOR_URL='http://localhost:8700/v2/services/$register'
export SERVICEKIT_HOST=host.docker.internal
export SERVICEKIT_PORT=8001
uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

`main:app` is right for a model with `main.py` at the top of its folder, which
is how chapkit models are laid out. If `main.py` is inside a package folder
instead, use `PACKAGE.main:app`.

It worked when `varde status`, run in the `mychap` folder, lists the model with
the state `unmanaged` and a LAST PING of a few seconds (unmanaged because varde
did not start it, which is expected).

More: [Your model from its checkout, with Chap](./use-cases/model-on-host.md).

### 13. A model image I built

In the model's folder:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t my-model:dev .
```

Then:

```sh
varde init mychap --models none
cd mychap
varde models add my-model:dev
varde up
varde status
```

It worked when `varde status` lists the model as `registered`. Usually it does
not the first time: the image registers under its own name, so `varde status`
shows it `unmanaged` next to `my-model` not registered, and the line under the
table gives the two commands that fix it (`varde models remove my_model`, then
`varde models add my-model:dev --service-id` with the name from the
`unmanaged` row). Run them, then `varde up` again.

More: [A model image you built yourself](./use-cases/local-model-image.md).

### 14. My own chap-core, with the models

For someone developing chap-core itself. They run chap-core from its folder,
listening on `0.0.0.0:8000`; varde runs the models. Have them start their
chap-core first: `varde init` then sees whether it runs in Docker and
configures the models to match.

```sh
varde init models --chap-core-url http://localhost:8000 --models chapkit_simple_multistep_model
cd models
varde up
varde status
```

It worked when `varde status` shows chap-core `up` and the model `registered`.
If chap-core was started after `varde up`, wait a few seconds and run
`varde status` again. `registered, unreachable` means chap-core cannot call the
model back, usually because chap-core was not running during `varde init`: the
line under the table gives the command that fixes it.

More: [chap-core from its checkout, with the models](./use-cases/chap-core-on-host.md).

### 15. chap-core built from my checkout

For someone changing chap-core who wants to run their version with models.
Replace the path with where they cloned chap-core:

```sh
varde init mychap --source ~/dev/chap-core --models default
cd mychap
varde up
varde status
```

The first `varde up` builds chap-core and takes several minutes (longer on an
Apple Silicon Mac). It worked when `varde status` shows chap-core `up` and the
models registered. After changing the code, `varde up` again rebuilds it.

More: [chap-core built from its checkout](./use-cases/chap-core-from-checkout.md).

### 16. My own DHIS2, with Chap

For someone who already runs DHIS2 on this machine (for DHIS2 or app work).
Ask whether their DHIS2 runs in Docker. If it does not:

```sh
varde init mychap --models default
cd mychap
varde up
varde dhis2 use http://localhost:8080 --chap-url http://localhost:8700
varde dhis2 connect
```

If it runs in Docker, it reaches Chap through `host.docker.internal`:

```sh
varde init mychap --models default
cd mychap
varde up
varde dhis2 use http://localhost:8080 --chap-url http://host.docker.internal:8700
varde dhis2 connect
```

It worked when `varde dhis2 connect` finishes without `error:`. If it says it
has no credentials, put `DHIS2_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `DHIS2_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (or
`DHIS2_API_TOKEN`) in the `.env` file and run it again. On a DHIS2 varde did not start it sets only
the route: if its `skipped:` lines say an app is missing, `varde dhis2 apps`
installs it, and `varde dhis2 analytics` generates the tables the Modeling App
reads.

On DHIS2 2.42 and later it can then say `DHIS2 refused the route`: their
DHIS2 only proxies to the addresses its own `dhis.conf` allows. Tell them to
add the `--chap-url` address, with no path (for example
`route.remote_servers_allowed = https://*,http://localhost:8700`), to their
DHIS2's `dhis.conf`, restart their DHIS2, and run `varde dhis2 connect` again.
A value with a path, such as `http://localhost:8700/**`, stops DHIS2 from
starting at all.

More: [A DHIS2 you run yourself, with Chap from varde](./use-cases/dhis2-dev-with-chap.md).

### 17. A DHIS2, with my own chap-core

For someone developing chap-core who wants DHIS2 and the Modeling App in front
of it. Their chap-core must listen on `0.0.0.0:8000`. Needs 8 GB of
memory for Docker.

```sh
varde init lab --chap-core-url http://localhost:8000 --with dhis2
cd lab
varde up
varde status
```

Then, once `varde status` shows chap-core `up` (`varde dhis2 connect` waits
for DHIS2 by itself):

```sh
varde dhis2 connect
varde open dhis2
```

It worked when `varde dhis2 connect` finishes without `error:` and the login
`admin` / `district` works.

More: [A DHIS2 from varde, with a chap-core elsewhere](./use-cases/dhis2-with-chap-core-elsewhere.md).

### 18. Two of these at the same time

Every option uses the same ports, so a second one needs its own. Create the
second one with these added to its `varde init` line, one flag per piece it
has (`--ocs-port` only with OCS, `--dhis2-port` only with DHIS2; a flag for a
missing piece is an error):

| Piece | Flag |
| --- | --- |
| chap-core | `--api-port 8701` |
| models | `--port-base 5101` |
| OCS | `--ocs-port 8791` |
| DHIS2 | `--dhis2-port 8781` |

For example, a second option 2: `varde init second --models default --api-port
8701 --port-base 5101`.

For a third, use 8702, 8792, 8782 and 5201, and so on. It worked when both
folders' `varde status` say `up`. Running them one at a time needs none of
this; see the note below.

### 19. Evaluate a model on my own data

They have a dataset as a CSV, with a GeoJSON of the same name beside it. Do
not install Python or uv for them. In the directory with the data:

```sh
varde chap eval --model-name https://github.com/dhis2-chap/minimalist_example_r \
  --dataset-csv data.csv --output-file eval.nc
varde chap plot-backtest eval.nc --output-file eval.html
```

Use their model's GitHub URL in `--model-name`, or a marketplace id such as
`chapkit_ewars_model`: varde starts that model by itself, and they need no
`varde up`. Never give a `localhost` URL. The first run pulls
an image of about 12 GB, so tell them it takes some minutes. If varde stops with
`runs in docker`, run the same command with `varde chap --docker` and tell
them that the flag gives the container control of docker. If the directory of
an output file is not there, varde creates it.

It worked when the last lines say `chap finished; it wrote eval.nc` and
`chap finished; it wrote eval.html`. They open `eval.html` in a browser.

More: [Evaluating a model on your own data](./use-cases/evaluate-with-chap-cli.md),
which goes from installing varde to a comparison of two models, and
[The chap CLI](./chap-cli.md).

## What to try next without DHIS2

Option 2 has no user interface, but the same evaluation the Modeling App runs
works from the terminal. In the `mychap` folder:

```sh
varde models test --all --backtest
varde jobs
```

The first line makes every enabled model train, forecast and run an evaluation
through chap-core on sample data the model generates itself, and prints the
scores. For CHAP-EWARS it takes under a minute. `varde jobs` lists what
chap-core did. To see it in the Modeling App instead, add DHIS2 to the same
folder (8 GB of memory for Docker):

```sh
varde components enable dhis2
varde up
```

then continue as in option 1 from `varde dhis2 connect`. See
[Growing a deployment](./use-cases/growing.md).

## Getting climate data

For options 3, 6 and 10, once OCS is `up`. OCS covers Laos until the person
changes the extent (the `--ocs-name`, `--ocs-country` and `--ocs-bbox` flags of
`varde init`). Six years of monthly rainfall, public, no account needed; it
takes a few minutes and the command waits:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8790/ingestions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"dataset_id": "chirps3_precipitation_monthly", "start": "2019-01", "end": "2024-12"}'
```

It worked when the answer contains `"status":"completed"`.
`curl http://localhost:8790/data-sources` lists every other dataset;
temperature (`era5land_temperature_monthly`) needs a Copernicus account, whose
key goes in `.env`. To get the values out per province as the CSV Chap reads,
or as a NetCDF file, follow
[Getting it out](./use-cases/ocs-alone.md#getting-it-out) step by step.

## Every option: stop, start, remove

```sh
varde down                    # stop everything; the data is kept
varde up                      # start it again
varde down --volumes --yes    # stop and delete all the data
```

After `varde down --volumes --yes` the folder can be deleted.

Two options use the same ports, so only one runs at a time. When `varde up`
says a port is used by another deployment and asks whether to stop it, answer
`y`: the other one keeps its data, and `varde up` in its folder starts it
again; `varde up --replace` is the same `y` given in advance. While the other one is
up, `varde status` in this folder says this deployment's chap-core is not
running and names the one that is.
