# Push the six Apple signing secrets from 1Password into GitHub, for the
# macOS signing and notarization steps in .github/workflows/release.yml.
#
# Every value is read from 1Password first and only then uploaded: a run that
# cannot read one of the six aborts before it has set any of them, rather than
# leaving half the secrets replaced. The values are held in shell variables for
# the length of the run and piped into `gh secret set`, so they never touch
# disk, never appear in the process list, and are never echoed. Only the secret
# names are printed.
#
# Two scopes, chosen with --scope:
#
#   --scope repo   (the default) sets the six secrets on winterop-com/chaps
#                  alone. Nothing else in the organisation can read them.
#
#   --scope org    sets them once for the winterop-com organisation with
#                  `--visibility selected --repos chaps`, so the same values
#                  can later be shared with another repository by adding it to
#                  that list instead of uploading the certificate again. The
#                  same six secrets already exist as repository secrets on
#                  winterop-com/maneki; promoting them to the organisation is
#                  the tidier end state, but it needs admin rights on the
#                  organisation and it does not remove maneki's own copies.
#
# Either way the workflow reads them as plain `secrets.APPLE_*`: a repository
# secret shadows an organisation secret of the same name, so setting both is
# harmless but pointless.
#
# Prerequisites: `gh auth login` with repo access (and admin:org for
# --scope org), and `op signin` for the 1Password account holding the item.
#
# The .p12 behind APPLE_CERTIFICATE must be exported with `openssl pkcs12
# -export -legacy ...` (or from Keychain Access): an OpenSSL 3 default export
# fails on the macOS runner with "MAC verification failed during PKCS12 import"
# even with the right password. See docs/development.md, "Preparing the Apple
# certificate".
#
# Adjust OP_VAULT and OP_ITEM below, or pass them in the environment, to match
# where the Developer ID material actually lives:
#
#   OP_VAULT="Engineering" OP_ITEM="Apple Developer ID" scripts/github-secrets.sh
#
# The item is expected to have one field per secret; the field names are the
# right-hand side of each SECRETS entry and can be edited there.
