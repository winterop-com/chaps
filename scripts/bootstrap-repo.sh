# This is a one-time script. It creates the repository, pushes main, switches
# GitHub Pages to the Actions build source so .github/workflows/docs.yml can
# deploy the book, points the repository's About link at the published site,
# and finally hands over to scripts/github-secrets.sh for the Apple signing
# secrets.
#
# Every command is printed before it runs, so a dry run doubles as the
# checklist for doing it by hand.
#
# Prerequisites: `gh auth login` with rights to create repositories in the
# organisation, and a local `main` branch with at least one commit.
