## Unstable

This is the rolling build of \`main\`. It is rebuilt and replaced on every
push, and it is not a release: it reports the version of the last tag,
\`v${version}\`, with \`channel dev\`, and anything in it may change or break.
The numbered releases are the stable ones.

Built from commit \`${sha}\` on ${built}.

## Install

\`\`\`sh
curl -fsSL ${script} | sh -s -- --version dev
\`\`\`

Or into the current directory alone, as \`./chaps\`, touching nothing else:

\`\`\`sh
curl -fsSL ${script} | sh -s -- --version dev --here
\`\`\`

A dev build follows this release from then on: \`chaps self update\` moves it
to the newest build of \`main\`, comparing commits rather than version
numbers, and \`chaps self version\` says \`channel dev\`. To go back to the
stable release:

\`\`\`sh
chaps self update --version v${version}
